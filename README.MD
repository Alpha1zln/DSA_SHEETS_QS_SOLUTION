* HOW TO USE GITHUB ---

‚Ä¶or create a new repository on the command line
```
echo "# DSA_SHEETS_QS_SOLUTION" >> README.md

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Alpha1zln/DSA_SHEETS_QS_SOLUTION.git
git push -u origin main
```

‚Ä¶or push an existing repository from the command line
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/Alpha1zln/DSA_SHEETS_QS_SOLUTION.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

HOW TO UPLOAD CODES FROM LAPTOP TO GITHUB ---

üóÇÔ∏è Setup Summary:
You have a main folder: DSA_Sheets (on both laptop & GitHub).
Inside DSA_Sheets are 10 subfolders (e.g., Arrays, Strings, etc.)
You want to weekly add 10 new solutions and push them to GitHub.

‚úÖ Step-by-step Guide:

‚úÖ 1. Initial Git Setup (Only once)
If not already done:

cd path/to/DSA_Sheets   # Go inside your main folder
```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/DSA_Sheets.git
git branch -M main
```
Replace the URL with your actual GitHub repo link.

‚úÖ 2. Weekly Routine to Add & Push Code
Each week:
‚úÖ Add your 10 files in their respective subfolders.

‚úÖ Stage the new files:
```
git add .         # Adds all new/modified files
```
You can also do:
```
git add Arrays/q1.cpp if you want to add specific files.
```

‚úÖ Commit your weekly update:
```
git commit -m "Week 3: Added 10 new DSA solutions"
```

‚úÖ Push to GitHub:
```
git push origin main
```

üí° Pro Tip: Avoid pushing unnecessary files
Create a .gitignore in DSA_Sheets folder with:
*.exe
*.out
*.log
*.class
.DS_Store
__pycache__/

Then run:
```
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "Applied .gitignore"
```

‚úÖ Optional: Weekly Branches (for practice)
If you want to maintain weekly progress:
```
git checkout -b week_3     # Create new branch
git add .
git commit -m "Week 3 solutions"
git push -u origin week_3
```

And later:
git checkout main
git merge week_3
git push origin main

üìå Done!
Your weekly uploads are now fully Git-enabled ‚Äî just remember to add, commit, and push every time you add new solutions.


*******************************************************************************************************
***** other ways --- using branch ---

Sure! Here's a clean and complete step-by-step guide based on your setup:

‚úÖ SCENARIO:
You already have a main folder on your PC (DSA_Sheets) with 10 subfolders, and some files.
You've already created a GitHub repo called DSA_Sheets.

You want to:
‚úÖ Create a new branch like week1
‚úÖ Push your local code to that branch
‚úÖ Later, merge it into main on GitHub via a Pull Request
‚úÖ Exclude .exe files from being pushed
‚úÖ FINAL GUIDE (Only once: First Time Setup)

üìÅ Step 1: Navigate to Your Local Folder
cd path/to/DSA_Sheets

üîß Step 2: Initialize Git & Connect to GitHub
```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/DSA_Sheets.git
```

and one should create - 
create readme.md and .gitignore files in repo.
Readme.md => Should have project details of repo
.gitignore file => Contents of it mentioned below [files that user doesn't want to be uploaded on git from local laptop]

optional ...              
Then run:
```
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```
This pulls the GitHub repo (with README etc.) into your local project without deleting your local files.


                             
üìù Step 3: Create a .gitignore File
To ignore .exe files and other junk:
echo "*.exe" >> .gitignore
echo "*.out" >> .gitignore
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
Optional: Open and manually edit .gitignore for more rules.


                             
üå± Step 4: Create and Switch to a New Branch (week1)
```
git checkout -b week1
```

‚ûï Step 5: Add and Commit Your Local Files
```
git add .
git commit -m "Week 1: Initial upload of DSA solutions"
```

‚òÅÔ∏è Step 6: Push to GitHub (to the week1 branch)
```
git push -u origin week1
```

‚úÖ Your code will now appear under the week1 branch on GitHub.
                             
‚úÖ FOR LATER WEEKS
Each week:
Add new files in local PC
Run:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Week 2: Added 10 more questions"
git push origin week1
```

Or you can create a new branch each week:
```
git checkout -b week2
```
-then repeat push steps
                             
üîÅ OPTIONAL: Merge week1 into main on GitHub
Go to GitHub
Click ‚ÄúCompare & Pull Request‚Äù
Merge week1 ‚Üí main

***********************************************************************************************
‚ùì EXTRA: What if README already exists in GitHub?

If your GitHub repo has a README and your local repo is new, run:
```
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Then resolve any merge messages, commit, and push.

‚úÖ Run this command only once, and only if:
You already created a GitHub repo with a README file or LICENSE or any default file.

And your local folder (PC) already has code, but you did not clone the repo ‚Äî instead, you did git init directly in your local folder.

üß† Why is this needed?
Because Git sees your local history and the remote GitHub history as two unrelated histories. So you must allow Git to merge them manually.

üïí WHEN to run it?
After you do:
```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/DSA_Sheets.git
```

Then run:
```
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```
This pulls the GitHub repo (with README etc.) into your local project without deleting your local files.

‚úÖ Then continue normally:
```
git add .
git commit -m "First merge with GitHub README"
git push -u origin main
```

or (if using week1 branch):
```
git checkout -b week1
git push -u origin week1
```

Let me know if you want a clean cheat sheet for this full setup.

***********************
.gitignore file ****
Yes, you can and should manually create the .gitignore file in your repo folder ‚Äî both locally and on GitHub if needed.

‚úÖ How to create .gitignore manually:

Option 1: Locally in your folder (Recommended)
Go to your main folder (e.g., DSA_Sheets)
Create a .gitignore file using a text editor:
On Windows: Right-click ‚Üí New ‚Üí Text Document ‚Üí Rename to .gitignore

Or use command line:
```
cd DSA_Sheets
touch .gitignore      # Linux/Mac or Git Bash on Windows
```

Open .gitignore and paste:
*.exe
*.out
*.log
*.class
.DS_Store
__pycache__/
Save and close.

Then run in terminal:
```
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "Apply .gitignore rules"
```

Option 2: Directly on GitHub (if no local file yet)
Go to your GitHub repo.
Click Add file ‚Üí Create new file.
Name the file .gitignore

Paste the ignore rules:
*.exe
*.out
*.log
*.class
.DS_Store
__pycache__/
Click Commit new file.

üéØ Why .gitignore matters:
It ensures that unnecessary or junk files like .exe, .class, or Python cache folders never get pushed to your GitHub repo.
